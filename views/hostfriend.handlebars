                <h3>Your Role</h3>
                <p>As a host friend, you will be trained to understand the concept of global forced migration and what it is like to be a refugee in 2017. After successful completion of your training modules, you will be virtually connected to a refugee in transition who will be arriving to your country in a few weeks. Your friendship will begin online prior to their departure and will continue for 4 to 6 months after your refugee friend has arrived in the country. You will begin the journey with sharing stories and learning from each otherâ€™s experiences during which time you will also be assisting your refugee friend with any queries they may have about their future home.  Where possible, you will be organising meet-ups with your friend and participate in other social activities after the arrival in the country.</p>
                <blockquote>As a host friend, your role is to support your refugee friend as he or she prepares to be relocated to your country. In many cases, you will be the only contact he or she has upon arrival in your country.</blockquote>
